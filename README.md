# stackoverflow-login
A short, handy python script to automatically login to SO. What is it good for? You can use it as a boilerplate script to build any other automated stuff on it or just to earn your "Enthuastic" or "Fanatic" badge (30 or 100 consecutive days of visit).

Set a cronjob to whatever time you want the login magic to be happen. E.g., run the script every day at 10:30 pm.
